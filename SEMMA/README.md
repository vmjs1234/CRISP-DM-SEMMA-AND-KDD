Data Mining Using SEMMA: Analyzing Bear Attacks Dataset
Data mining is a powerful process to extract hidden patterns from large datasets, providing valuable insights across many domains. One of the structured methodologies used for data mining is SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess). In this article, weâ€™ll explore how the SEMMA process was applied to the Bear Attacks dataset to uncover patterns, assess the severity of attacks, and develop predictive models.
