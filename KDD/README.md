Uncovering Insights from Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Using the KDD Process
As mobile devices have become an integral part of our daily lives, understanding user behavior offers valuable insights into optimizing performance and enhancing user experiences. With large volumes of data being generated by mobile usage, data mining techniques provide a structured approach to extract meaningful knowledge from these datasets. In this article, weâ€™ll explore how we applied the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process to analyze a comprehensive mobile device usage and user behavior dataset.
